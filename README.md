TGAsynController


The models and programs present are based on Discrete Event Systems and Timed Game Automata. Programs were developed to automate the process of controllers synthesizing using the Modeling, Simulation and Verification software UPPAAL TIGA

The purpose of these developed programs is to facilitate and speed up the achievement of results using the proposed method for synthesizing controllers.

Some models were made based on the behavior of processes on the computer integrated manufacturing platform, called MecatrIME, located in the Mechatronic laboratory at the Military Engineering Institute (IME)
